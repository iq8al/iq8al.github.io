            <p>The question of Malaysia's schools not doing its part in fostering unity among
Malaysians have been brought up again due to TN50<sup id="fnref:Ref1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Ref1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and Business FM did a program to
source opinions from the general public.</p>
<p>I followed the podcast on <a href="http://www.bfm.my/talkback-thursday-unity-in-schools.html">BFM's TALKBACK THURSDAY: UNITY IN SCHOOLS</a></p>
<p>It was an enlightening podcast that puts light on the thoughts and feelings of the
general public on where they think the schooling institution in Malaysia should
head in the context as a tool to promote social unity. </p>
<p>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Malaysia">Education in Malaysia</a> for a 
quick primer on the history of schools in Malaysia, or search for <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=controversy+vernacular+schools+malaysia&amp;oq=controversy+vernacular+schools+malaysia&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6788j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=pros+and+cons+of+vernacular+school">controversy of vernacular schools 
in Malaysia</a>
for some more background reading. The <a href="http://penanginstitute.org/v3/resources/articles/statistics/714-demographics-of-a-diverse-malaysia">Penang
Institute</a>
also has data on the diverse demographics of children attending the different
schools. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Pua">Tony Pua</a> also
<a href="http://educationmalaysia.blogspot.jp/2007/03/national-vs-vernacular-schools.html">wrote</a>
about vernacular schools with insights on how the vernacular school
educationists look at the rhetoric of their schools being the reason of our
disunity.</p>
<h2>The current times questions the difference</h2>
<p>By and large the callers basically supported a single-stream school, but many with
caveats, such as pointing to the failures of the so-called national school to be
to be regarded as a symbol of excellence and is part to blame the rise of
so-called vernacular schools.</p>
<p>A Twitter poll by BFM also suggested that the majority who took the poll
supported a single-stream school:</p>
<p><img alt="BFM's Poll for Single Stream School" src="http://iqbalabd.me/ja/images/bfm-single-stream-school-unity.png" /></p>
<p>I have my own thoughts on schools in Malaysia, and it's perceived position as a
tool for national unity.</p>
<h2>Why is education a partisan issue?</h2>
<p>Education for our children, by itself is a subject that we should all be in
agreement. <em>All</em> of us wants the best for our children. We want them to have
good grades, enjoy school life, eat nutritional food at school and grow up a
happy, compasionate, intelligent and balanced child. But this issue now has became a partisan
issue.</p>
<p>I am also sure that we all agree that as a nation, a good education for our children is an
important part of building the future of our nation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has became a partisan issue when we take things which are not directly
related to education that aims to develop our children into that balanced human
being, such as racial or religious identity into the equation.</p>
<p>Racial or religious identity are exlusive to a particular person or group in the society
and these are the things that puts us apart instead of bringing us together.
When we bring these identities to the public sphere and relate to them it will
of course create exlusitivity and if it's something that not all of us can strive to be (like
race for example) then it will eventually create resentment.</p>
<p>Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong in being a Dayak who is a Buddhist
or a half-Thai half-Chinese Christian or a Javanese half-Bajau Muslim. All are
Malaysian and all want a better future.</p>
<p>In the context of our children what is important is that they know that these people 
exists in our society. They are our neigbours, the people that we see at shops, buy things
from, sell things to. They are the ones which we should help when they ask for
help, and they are also the ones that will help us when we need  help.
They too want their children to grow up a compasionate, intelligent and healthy
member of society.</p>
<p>Unless we can scientifically prove that excellence are born with a certain race, 
it doesn't make any sense to insist a person of a certain skin colour is
only eligable to run a certain public school. </p>
<p>Instead of trying to satisfy nonsense demands and requirements that do not
improve the education level of our children, our public education should 
refocus itself on what is universally important to the growth of a child into becoming 
a young adult capable of thinking for herself what is good for her own future, 
regardless of skin colour or faith.</p>
<h2>The public shool focus is on education, and not just a tool to unite society</h2>
<p>Look at it another way: The current rheoteric that we're seeing basically also
says that part of the blame for our national disunity are on schools, but when in fact schools in
it's pure form should only be focusing on giving education to our children.</p>
<p>The subject of national unity is <em>beyond</em> our public schools and doesn't stop
there. Our 7-year old child starting her formal education doesn't care what skin
colour she is, or what colour her new friend that'll be sitting next to her in
class will be.</p>
<h1>Disunity is not a problem that the schools started</h1>
<p>Every child when born doesn't know what race or religion is. If they know that
they are <em>different</em> than other people and should only stick to their own kind by the time 
they get to primary school, then the problem of disunity has started even before
getting to the schools. How would we expect schools to solve a problem which it
did not start?</p>
<p>Don't make our public schools one of the scapegoats of our inability to get our
act together, and don't expect the schools to solve a problem it did not
start.</p>
<h1>Focusing on good education and it's resources</h1>
<p>To achieve the level of education that we expect for our children requires us to
step back and reasses the ability of us to educate them the way we want them to
be. It is a fool's errand to say that we want the best, when we are only willing
or able to move forward at a mediocre level.</p>
<p>Having capable teachers, and teachers who can focus only on teaching without
being burdened with adminstrative tasks is a no-brainer and I know we are aware 
of the need to focus and fix these problems.</p>
<p>One other aspect that have not being discussed though is the fact that we're
spreading our resources thin due to political pressure based on racial or
religious identity instead of educational needs.</p>
<p>For example, if a child wants to learn a particular language, why would she
need to go to a vernacular school to do so? Why shouldn't we give the
opportunity for <em>all</em> our children to learn these different languages at any
school that they go to?</p>
<p>The only obvious reason this is happening is that we don't
have enough capable teachers to go around all of our schools.</p>
<p>It does not make rational or scientific sense to say we need a totally different
school stream just to learn a language.</p>
<p>Instead of having teachers assigned to different schools all over the
country, we should have lesser amount of schools. The different languages, or
subjects that are being taught differently at vernacular schools should be
made avaialable and taught at all the schools that we have.</p>
<p>What works at the the better schools should be shared and emulated among other
schools, increasing the education level bar evenly across all our schools.</p>
<p>Robin, one of the callers pointed out that vernacular schools strive because they do
offer something or maybe even do something better which are missing from the national schools.
We should figure this out, and emulate them on all our schools.</p>
<p>It makes sense to have a single stream school, where everyone can learn all
these different languages with everyone else. We will have a single budget, and
a single focus on education, practicing best practices learned via a single way to run
all our schools, with less overhead burden due to the different wants or
political needs that has nothing to do with a good education. Our teaching resources will be
more focused on teaching rather than than be bogged down by non-educational matters.</p>
<p>Within the public education sphere, languages should be regarded as just
another tool to communicate and to educate our children, and are
just subjects to be learned instead of them being symbols of racial or religious
identities.</p>
<h2>Mixed signals: It's confusing and it's insane</h2>
<p>Judging from the perspective that our general public is viewing our school
system, we're not doing very well. Most of us complain that our children are
being burdened by more and more things to learn, and at the same time they are
not getting to know one another any better.</p>
<p>Year in and year out, we focus on the amount of <em>As</em> that our children get, how
many did not get the scholarship that they want, how many couldn't speak good
English, and how they are getting more and more polarised day by day.</p>
<p>But the fact is in essence we're not changing the way we're teaching our
children. We think we give them education by adding all these new information
and subjects at school for them to pass exams, and we think we're giving them
"education", but are we?</p>
<p>When we read the news of children killing themselves because they did not get
the results that they wanted, we raise our hands and say what have we done? </p>
<p>But we continue to demand As as if this is the only way forward and complain
when there is not enough places in the universities because tens of thousands of
other children also received more <em>As</em>.</p>
<p>The same goes for putting the schools as a scapegoat for our disunity. We say we want
our people to unite and be treated as one and as equals, but when we say all our
schools should be one and all our children learn under a single roof, we raise
our hands and shout and say that <em>we need to protect culture</em> and it's <em>racism
and discrimination</em>.</p>
<p>We are just making our children confused by saying something and doing something
else. They will just grow up cynical and untrusting of the adults they see, and
worst, they will grow up <em>into</em> those exact same adults.</p>
<p>Now, sixty years down the road when we started of with our current formula of
education, have we achieved in terms of quality or strength among our society
that we wanted to achieve at that time? Just judging from what our society is
debating right now, it does not seem so. </p>
<p>If we expect different results now, but without changing the approach we have been
taking all this while, we are insane!</p>
<h2>Our multiculturalism does not die with the schools.</h2>
<p>It dies when we only care about our own lot.</p>
<p>Remove all references to a particular language or race types of school, 
from vernacular schools, the Malay College to the MRSM schools by MARA<sup id="fnref:footnote1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> 
schools and make all these schools accessible without prejudice to any child of Malaysia.</p>
<p>If we want to play divisive politics and call out each other by their skin
colour, fine. But leave our children and <em>their</em> schools out of it.</p>
