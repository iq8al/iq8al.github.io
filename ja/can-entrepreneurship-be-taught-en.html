            <p><a href="http://www.mymagic.my/about/">MaGIC</a>'s <a href="https://cherylyeoh.com/">Cheryl Yeoh</a> 
gave her views on if entrepreneurship can be taught in <a href="http://bit.ly/1FbbK89">The Star, March 3
2015</a></p>
<p>I would like to add my comments, based on my different experiences and
motivation from the context of teaching entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>My views on entrepreneurship are purely based on experience. I did not have any
formal education on entrepreneurship, (I am trained as an engineer) nor my
immediate family members have been examples of entrepreneurship. As it is now,
out my siblings and my parents, only I are currently earning a living from a
business that I run.</p>
<p>From these experiences of mine, I believe that entrepreneurship are not
dissimilar to fado, the traditional music of Lisbon. You can nuture the feel for
fado (having many fado houses and public performances, as well as exposure from
the media), you can learn how to write and perform fado (by watching and
learning from the great fado maestros on how they perform their art) but alas
you cannot teach fado. There will be pointers on techniques which you can pass
on, but it is impossible for you to teach "how to fado". This sentiment is
echoed by all the great fado players, and I am very sure it is the same for any
art form.</p>
<p>Which brings me to an interesting take on entrepreneurship that I believe in:
That it is a mix of science and art form. It is science from the way that you
measure success: Because it is a business, you can measure what is the profit
margin, or the earnings per stock, or valuation or market capitalization. Based
on this numbers, so called investor will tell you if a business is growing,
stagnating or losing ground and if you should invest in a certain business. The
more these numbers show a positive trend, the better it is for the business</p>
<p>But how do you get to that measurable success is, at the very best, not
measurable. Best practices from a certain market, when brought over might not
work the same way in a different market. The best we have the franchise types
turn key model which implements best practices but by different people, but even
that still doesn't work the same all the time everywhere.</p>
<p>Successful entrepreneurship requires more than understanding the numbers and
theories like what we learn in a business school sitting for an MBA. Business
and entrepreneurship are two different animals: A successful entrepreneur can
create a successful business, but a successful business might not create the
successful entrepreneur.</p>
<p>In that context I very much agree with what Cheryl has pointed out: That the
Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP) does not look at purely the numbers
of startup companies created. A performance indicator to gauge if
entrepreneurship is taking hold that is based the amount of companies created is
nonsensical.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense and it doesn't show anything other than, well, the amount
of companies created.</p>
<p>A top-down approach stating a target of so and so amount of companies should be
created to boost entrepreneurship, which I have noticed we, from time and time
again prefer to do, will only lead to more insubstantial companies and nonsense
capital distribution, with very little impact on creating resilient and
successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Instead, a much more pedal-to-steel indicator that directly connects to the
would-be entrepreneurs will serve this purpose better. We can learn from
Stanford on how they use the amount of students who oversubscribe to their
courses or the ratings the students have given. Entrepreneurship is a career
path; For me personally, it is a way to live.</p>
<p>We should treat entrepreneurship like any other career path. Students from young
should know that being an entrepreneur is also a viable career, like being a
policewoman, a mechanic, a pilot, or a lawyer or a doctor. But unlike a
policewoman who enforces the law or a pilot who flies a plane, the entrepreneur
creates value to the public and her customers by solving problems with a purpose
that will be sustainable for her, her family and her employees.</p>
<p>But in the end, it is up to the entrepreneur on why she decides to become one.
For the pilot, it might be the blue skies and travelling the world. For the
policewoman, it might be because of her sense of justice and conviction. This
reason or purpose, in the end, is the single most important driver behind
successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Knowing wanting to achieve this goal and being able to do so by creating
sustainable value is the first step of being an entrepreneur. Unfortunately this
cannot be taught. What we, as the society and the education system can the best
do is to say that these goals can be achieved and have tangible tools like
infrastructure and access to human and monetary capital accessible.</p>
<p>Like any good artist, give them the tools, step back and watch them work! </p>
