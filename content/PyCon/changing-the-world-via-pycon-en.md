Summary: Thinking back on what I've done for PyCon and how it all started in the first place.

As an engineer, programming languages are very important tools to solve the
problems that you face. As an entrepreneur, they are also important tools to
bring your imagination to life, to get that profit and making that difference.

Python is a magnificent programming language. Although first released in 1991, it _arguably_
only started to become mainstream when Guido, the creator of Python joined Google in 2005.
That made many people start to notice how serious the tech giant was thinking
about Python. In the same year, the web framework Django which is written in Python
was released, and that further pushed Python into the limelight.

Now, even our very much loved
[Instagram uses python](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/) 
to handle it's hundreds of millions of requests. Python are also used in
scientific and academic fields

I have been using Python since 2002, and in many ways it has given me the
intellectual challenge I craved, allowed me the freedom to bring my imagination
to life, and through PyCon, has allowed me to meet wonderful people all over.

## My First PyCon, APAC 2010 in Singapore

[PyCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Conference) is in essence a conference
centered around the Python programming language. It's roots started with the first PyCon in
Washington D.C in 2003 and has expanded to many parts of the world, from Europe, Japan,
China, India, HK, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and also Malaysia.

Up until 2010, before attending my first PyCon, I had been using python for fun
and profit for 8 years. I find the language easy to use, has design that fits
with my mind and how I believe coding should be, and most importantly I enjoyed using
it to build stuff.

So when I saw the poster for the first PyCon APAC in Singapore in 2010, I
decided to meet the people behind it:

![PyCon APAC 2010 Singapore]({filename}/images/pycon/pycon-apac-2010-poster.png)

I didn't know anyone there but I'd thought I'll just make new friends and see
what other cool stuff they're building. And made friends I did: I met up with
three other participants from Japan Manabu Terada
([@terapyon](https://twitter.com/terapyon?lang=en)),

and it turns out that the chairperson for the first PyCon APAC in Singapore was Liew Beng Keat
([@bengkeatliew](https://twitter.com/bengkeatliew)) a Malaysian from Kuala
Lumpur.

# Bringing PyCon to the region

It was then that Beng Keat was telling me the reason he wanted to organize a
regional version of PyCon APAC: Beng Keat had the opportunity to attend PyCon in
the United States, and although he enjoyed the conference and came back englightened,
he also realized how prohibitive it is to travel from Asia to the United States
and so he thought: _If we can't go to PyCon in the US, we'll bring
PyCon here._ 

The concept of having a regional PyCon is in essence a very simple one, with a
well defined purpose: We understand that nearly all of the advances made in
technology by the programming language, new concepts and philosophy in thinking about the
language and even how communities are organized towards a greater good for
everyone at large originate mostly in the United States and Europe.

## Building the Japan PyCon community, circa 2011

We then invited Steve Holden to come to Tokyo, and over dinner we talked about
having an annual conference to get pythonistas from all over the country to come
and share their work and discuss their ideas. Steve was instrumental in proding
us, who have no experience at all running conferences, to actually take the idea
seriously. Given also the fact that Python wasn't still one of the top major
programming languages in Japan at that time, we were also skecptical

During dinner with Steve, we had a traditional Japanese _nabe_ (hot pot) dinner
and when the time came for us to put the live prawns into the boiling water, it
jumped out 

We had our first [_mini_ PyCon JP](https://sites.google.com/site/pyconminijp/) 
on a cold January morning in 2011 at the Rakuten offices in Tokyo. I was 
involved as the program manager, choosing talks and deciding the contents of the conference.
100 people came for the mini conference, and we all had a great time listening
to talks, learning and making new friends.

Encouraged by the turnout and how the first conferece went, we then decided to
have a major PyCon JP for the first time in that summer of 2011.

PyCon JP have been held every year around summer since then, and in 2016 our
attendees topped 700 people.

An issue that we faced after the second PyCon in 2012 was that it was getting
too big, and the left over money from sponsors was getting too much to handle
out from an individual account. We also needed a face for the public, and a
definate entity that will take responsibility for managing the annual conference
in Japan. 

Because of that, the non-profit PyCon JP was established in March 2013, which I
am still currently serving as part of the board members.

But a programming language is only as good as the people that uses it.

## The Asia Pacific Connection

Regionally, we have a loosely knit community that drives PyCon APAC
(Asia Pacific). PyCon APAC is a regional conference that rotates
between cities within the APAC region, and aims to be an international
and bigger conference giving the opportunity to the regional python
community to come together at a more accessible and affordable location compared to
having to travel to the United States or Europe.

After the APAC conference in Tokyo in 2013, after consensus from the regional
community representatives, it moved to Taipei for 2 years until 2015. The Korean
community, after having their first local PyCon in 2015 stepped up to the plate
to host APAC in 2016, with over 1000 attendees.

Our friends from Taipei, after attending PyCon APAC in Tokyo, was so hyped up
with the experience and they decided to host 


And that 



And that has caught on. I've seen fellow pythonistas who came to a Python for
the first time, and their eyes light up and smiling and saying now they want to
start something in their city and their community.

The collective knowledge of all of us help to remove some anxiety and help guide
them on what are the points that they'll need to keep in mind

## Connecting pythonistas in Malaysia

After helping out with running PyCon in Japan, I realized that all the PyCons
that we had in the APAC region has all been on the north-eastern part of Asia
Pacific, with the exception of Singapore. And all of them are cost and time
prohibitive to the rest of Asia Pacific.

And that begin my next project: To kickstart an annual PyCon in Malaysia geared
for the locals, and bring APAC and the rest of the world to Kuala Lumpur: _If we can't go
to PyCon, we'll bring PyCon._

In Malaysia, the history of PyCon started in 2014 where we had our
first mini PyCon (1 day, single track and 70 people attended) and
continued with PyCon MY 2015 (2 days, 2 tracks and around 140 people
attended) and PyCon MY 2016 (2 days, 2 track and around 100 people
attended). You can read more on us at [https://pycon.my/](https://pycon.my/)

# PyCon APAC in Kuala Lumpur

For 2017, after making a proposal to the APAC community, we have been
selected to hold the responsibility of having PyCon APAC 2017 in KL,
which will be held in August.

What I would like to take the opportunity to highlight here is the
wonderful work the community has done to bring PyCon APAC 2017, from
universities, student volunteers, local companies and most of all the
people that make up the community itself.

Personally in the Malaysian context, I believe we need more makers or
programmers in our ecosystem. I feel that we focus too much on the
business side of things, with "business focused" conferences like
match-making or raising capital. But these are all moot without the
actual people and know-how to build what we want to sell. PyCon MY is
that small ripple we're making to have a positive contribution to the
overall builders and programming ecosystem.

# Changing the world one PyCon at a time

In essence, the aim of an intellectual conference like a PyCon, similar to museums
and art galleries is to enlighten you and transform you to a different person from
the person that you were before attending the conference.

It doesn't have to be a huge transformation

For APAC this year and for the first time in the history of PyCon in Malaysia,
we are trying a few new things, that hopefully will 

Financial Aid
Tie up with Women Who Code
Having the conference at a commercial conference venue
Reducing waste
Subsidized ticketing



Through PyCon, the community also tries to practice common ground principles
based on universal ideas and ideals. All regional or local PyCons which requests
grants from the PSF are required to have a _Code Of Conduct_ that governs how
they organizers manage the conference, _and_ also how the attendess behave and
interact with one another during the conference.

These Code Of Conducts reflect the values of the community and what they think
is important. Not all talks during PyCons are about programming, web frameworks
or libraries: Some of them are about the experiences of the speaker to become
a female developer, or the need to have more diversity and how it's achieved 
through free community training programs

So in a way, PyCons are not only _just_ a technical conference that you might
expect from practicioners of a certain technology: It's also sort of a social
movement. Although in PyCons you do have booths for companies the commercial
aspects are very much watered down (as opposed to RISE or Web Summit) and people
come




In the PyCon context, I got involved in 2010 during the first PyCon
APAC in Singapore. Starting from there, I co-founded the conference in
Japan (PyCon JP, https://www.pycon.jp/committee/board.html) and in
2014 I founded the conference here in Malaysia. I work closely with my
counterparts around the region, to guide and drive growth for the
PyCond around the region.



After all these years and multiple places around the world, PyCon has
evolved to being just a mere conference of programming enthusiast
showing of their programs to a place where people meet to discuss new
ideas and create new opportunities together, based on the shared
values of the community.

Focused groups like PyLadies (python group focused on women),
DjangoCon (Conference focused on the Django framework) and SciPy
(Conference for the users of python in the academics and science
fields) also all contribute to the vibrant python community, while
PyCon is the general conference that tries to cover many usages of
python.


It would be great if we can have some airtime to talk about PyCon APAC
2017, to give exposure to the general public of the small, niche but
very much vibrant and evolving tech conference called PyCon that we
have.


The question of Malaysia's schools not doing its part in fostering unity among
Malaysians have been brought up again due to TN50[^Ref1], and Business FM did a program to
source opinions from the general public.
