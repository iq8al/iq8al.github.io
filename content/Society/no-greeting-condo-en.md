Summary: The cutting edge on living together in a condo

So I saw this on Twitter:

![Letter to the editor on no greeting condo]({filename}/images/no-aisatsu-twitter.png)

A person wrote to the local newspaper telling the story of his condominium
making a new rule to not allow greeting each other. 

As the story goes, one of the parents were telling the management comittee 
that they were teaching their children to not greet anyone that they know, 
and since it's difficult for children to know a person who is an occupant of the
condo complex or not, the parent were asking the comittee to make a rule to not
allow greetings in the condo complex.

At the same time, one of the older occupants were also saying that since their
greetings always goes unaswered and doesn't make them feel any better, why not
we just stop with all the greetings altogether? 

And so the occupants have reached an agreement not to greet each other, and now
they need to publish the new rule so that the rest of the condo complex
occupants know and follow it.
