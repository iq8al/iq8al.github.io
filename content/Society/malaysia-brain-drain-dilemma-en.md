Summary: My take on the Malaysian brain-drain dilemma

[This](http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/the-other-side-of-malaysias-brain-drain-story) 
article on The Malay Mail Online brought me thinking on this fine Saturday
morning of the 1st day of the New Lunar Year, and I want to write on what I
think of the _Malaysian Brain Drain Dilemma_

Malaysia spends time, money and effort to attract Malaysian overseas to return
to Malaysia and contribute back to the country. The idea of getting people to
contribute to the development of the country is on the right track: Heck, it's
the only track that we have! There are absolutely no alternatives to _not
wanting people_ to contribute.

On the other hand, I do not see the point of getting _Malaysians to Malaysia_ in
order to achieve that. I feel the narrative of showing better lives for
Malaysias who returned home after years away, or of Malaysians who succeeded
_because_ they left home is missing the point.

## In the 21st century you can be anywhere and still contribute

First, improvements in infrastructure, information technology and travel makes
it possible for any of us to be anywhere on this planet. In a 8-hour period you
can be in Helsinki or if you spend 30 hours, you can be in Beunos Aires. You can
communicate via email, share information on websites and discuss ideas face-to
face via Hangouts or Facetime.

People who want to contribute to something are passionate at what they do and 
will know that they want to contribute. The missing piece is the effort that we
spend to identify these people, reach out to them and connect them to like-minded
people or institutions that can help them amplify their contributions.

TalentCorp says they have approved 4000 people within a period of 5 years since
2011. Malaysian overseas are estimated at 1 million people, which translates to
only 0.004%. Is 1000 per year of people enough to contribute? Is 0.004% an
acceptable acception rate after 5 years? Are we doing too little, or is this too much?

Perhaps TalentCorp's mandate is to identify and attract talents with skills that
can only be utilized if they are present in the country, like surgeons to do
surugery. But we know contributing is more than that, and we need all the help
we can get, not only from the sciences but also engineering and arts.

We also must not forget the home grown talents and people that are doing
wonderous jobs. Overseas Malaysias have different backgrounds, ideas and
approaches to the same problem we all have and these differences are what we
want to be accesible to our home grown talents. They can learn from each other,
improve and make something better together. Creating the missing piece of connecting
these dots between locals and abroad is where we should put more effort in,
regardless if the overseas talent will be coming home.

## Home is where the heart is

The second part is the most important factor of all: Where we call home. 

Now, it's not where we're born with. Making a place home is a self-conscious
decision based on that particular person's situation, personality and opportunities. This
should and must be the overarching target for any returning program that we want
to carry out: Making Malaysia home.

Once someone calls a place home, the good and the bad will be taken in stride.
It is human nature to better their own home, for themselves and the generations
to come, and when we can get people who want to contribute calling Malaysia
their home, it will be a sustainable success story.

At the same time, as mentioned in the Malay Mail Online article above, there are
people who return home because life is tough in wherever they:

> “Who cares if there’s corruption and crime in Malaysia? I just go back, make
> heaps of money, then live in a condo with proper security. Solved. Whereas
> here, I’m just an average Joe, and I’m struggling just to keep my head above
> water”.  - See more at:

The next question is: How do you convince people to call Malaysia their home?


### And then it's not only Malaysians that we want
