In my day job I run [Xoxzo Inc.](https://info.xoxzo.com/) which provides a 
simple web API platform for telephony services. I am a business founder, 
a software engineer, founder and co-founders of [PyCon JP](https://pycon.jp/) 
and [PyCon MY](https://pycon.my/).

I am originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and has been a resident of Japan
since 1997. I graduated from the Engineering Faculty, Saga University.
I am currently residing in Nerima-ku, Tokyo.

I use git, practice design patterns and unit tests heavily.

Previously I worked for [Yahoo Japan, Inc.](http://docs.yahoo.co.jp/info/company/) as a software engineer and [Amazon
Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/) as a marketing manager.

I believe in 

* globalisation
* capitalism
* the ability of humans to think and work together for a common goal
* differences of opinions
* one way of writing code in python
* reading as a substitute to travelling
* the inherent responsibility of humans to do good for this world
* art as a filter to our consciousness
* giving and contributing back
* and sometimes all that I believe in above doesn't work out well so I need to figure something else out.
