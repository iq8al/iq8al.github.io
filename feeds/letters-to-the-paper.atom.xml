Malaysians. It was not published&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bringing back the idea&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Minister Gobind brought back the idea of a &lt;a href="http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1651523"&gt;digital ID for
Malaysians&lt;/a&gt;, we are
seeing a healthy debate going on concerning the feasibility or even
the need of a national digital ID. I would like to also contribute to
this debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I am who I say I am&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet was originally designed in such a way that it's
"stateless", which basically means it has no memory. This means that
if you visit a website and come again 3 seconds later that website
will treat you like a totally new person on your second and subsequent
visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously an issue when you need to get things done: You
won't have shopping carts, Instagram timelines, or friends on Facebook
because the internet can't differentiate between you and your
grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way innovative ways was invented to workaround this
limitation, such as "cookies" and sessions, which has evolved to
produce the user registration, username and password combination that
we so much love today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with this method is that no one is vouching for you: You
come up saying "this is who I am, and I'm vouching for myself that
this is true". For Facebook or Instagram where the most complex every
day use case is sharing pictures of cats or your rented Chanel
handbags, this is all fine, but if you need to do anything more that
comes with responsibilities and social consequences like registering
your new born child, renewing your business
license or making a loan application, someone needs to make sure that
you are who you say you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This should be the MAIN and ONLY purpose a national ID program should
perform: Verifying that you are who you say you are or in other words,
creating a "platform of trust" as termed by Minister Gobind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I don't trust you, but I trust that person that you trust&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design and nature of the internet I cannot trust you, but the funny
thing is I will trust something that you also trust. This "something"
naturally will fall to some central authority like the government,
because they are the issuer of identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that this concept is not new: We are already
using it in the HTTPS/TLS scheme (the padlock that you see in your
browser address bar to make sure you're accessing a secure site)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private entities like banks are also able to connect to this central
system. Using the state-issued ID card, you can access the myriad of
private services
that connects to the state and can verify that you are who you are. Once they
know who you are, you are then authorized to carry out actions based on the
services that you're currently accessing, like making money transfers
from your bank account, or renewing your driving license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A platform of trust based on officially sanctioned national-ID to
directly verify identity is more meaningful than indirect methods such
as sending SMS to mobile numbers that proves possession than identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the central authority should not (or MUST not) have access
to whatever you're doing online once you're passed the verification
phase. What you do, once you're verified, will only be between you and
the services you're utilizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A paper photostated IC is not "verification"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current way of doing things by the majority of Malaysians in regards of
identity verification is broken to say the best. We take our physical
ID and make physical paper copies of it to sign-up for services from
opening bank accounts to subscribing to mobile plans. This is far from
secure nor it is an effective form of identity verification and can be
easily abused. We have read of many cases where someone else have
signed up for something which the real owner of that identity doesn't
know of and instead is paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An online platform of trust will help us reduce the likelihood of abuse by
taking away the physical aspect of the identity verification, which will also
lead to a more efficient workflow since data can be processed much
more easily than physical record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having said that, we also must understand and appreciate this: No
technology is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It's not if but WHEN&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear that a central authority being hacked is justified and it is
a risk which needs to be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the technology context, we mitigate this risk by increasing the hurdles
before any hacked data is made usable, and minimize the damage &lt;strong&gt;WHEN&lt;/strong&gt;
(and not if) there is data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this by ensuring that the hacked data is unusable without a
second factor, such as an encrypted physical ID which is not connected
in any way to the central system. Those physical ID can also be locked
by passwords which are stored on the ID itself, and supposedly known
only to the ID holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if an aspiring hacker wants to steal the data of the
citizens of Malaysia, they need to hack the central system, and steal
30 million ID cards AND also figure out the password to access that
physical device. At the same time, third-parties like banks which access
the central system to verify identity will not have the identity verification
information on them, which means if the banks are hacked, the hacker will
know how much money an account has but will not know who that account
belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Estonia's E-Residency programme&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am enrolled in the Estonian E-Residency program, where the state
vouches for you and issues a state sanctioned ID card which you can
use to connect to state services online. The ID card does not have my
picture on it, and is not valid as a self-identification document in
the physical world. Estonia's E-Residency system employs the same
scheme for personal verification and authentication I have explained
above. It is also used by her 1.3 million citizens to access
government services, other than e-residents (which can access the same
services too!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of kilometers away, day or night, in my living room or in my
favorite local cafe, I can sign agreements, check the status of my
applications and operate my business and get on with my life without
having to wait in line or getting stuck in traffic because all the
different moving parts that I need to interact with know with a very
high probability and confidence that I am who I say I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I know 1.3 million people versus Malaysia's 30 million people is
a huge difference, but that is the beauty of technology: You can scale it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So..&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need this? I truly believe so. In fact, I believe it is inevitable. The
technology is already there, it is open and we have no need to invent
anything new. The actual example of implementing it state wide is also
there (Estonia) as well as any leanings or know-how. It has been done
and it has been proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to be connected online is now starting to be accepted as a
universal human right. Coupled with the constant business needs to get
better efficency and savings, being able to do work and business
online will become more and more of a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing us to do business and deal with bureaucracy online will free up
tremendous amount of time that we can use to enrich ourselves in many other
ways. This is in the end what technology is supposed to be about:
Empowering us human beings by allowing us to regain back our most
valuable resource: time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more relevant and important question is when?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously as a country of limited resources there is the question of
prioritization. I will leave that question as a homework to be
answered by our elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before go forth, an important issue we must address before we
embark on this project, as &lt;a href="https://www.malaymail.com/s/1683682/dear-politicians-digital-ids-are-a-terrible-idea"&gt;pointed out by Ms. Erna Mahyuni in her
piece&lt;/a&gt;,
is that Malaysia does not have a good track record of enforcing
privacy laws, and top top that off a very low understanding of privacy
and privacy rights. This is a larger issue which should be addressed,
regardless of having a national digital ID or not, as it is effecting
us all, right here, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I believe the creation of a national digital ID as a base for a
platform of trust to empower citizens of Malaysia is inevitable in
order to continue to being relevant and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="current affairs"></category><category term="malaysia"></category><category term="digital ids"></category><category term="estonia"></category><category term="gobind singh deo"></category></entry><entry><title>The Malaysia's brain drain dilemma</title><link href="http://iqbalabd.me/the-malaysian-brain-drain-dilemma.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-28T11:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2017-01-28T11:00:00+09:00</updated><author><name>Iqbal Abdullah</name></author><id>tag:iqbalabd.me,2017-01-28:/the-malaysian-brain-drain-dilemma.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My take on the Malaysian brain-drain dilemma&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the original article which was published on 28th Feb 2017 in The Malay Mail Online
titled &lt;a href="http://m.themalaymailonline.com/what-you-think/article/believing-in-malaysias-future-and-potential-iqbal-abdullah"&gt;Believing in Malaysia’s future and
potential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/the-other-side-of-malaysias-brain-drain-story"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; 
article concerning Malaysia's brain drain phenomena on The Malay Mail Online 
brought me thinking on this fine Saturday morning of the 1st day of the
New Lunar Year, and I want to write on what I think of the &lt;em&gt;Malaysian Brain Drain Dilemma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia spends time, money and effort to attract Malaysian overseas to return
to Malaysia and contribute back to the country. The idea of getting people to
contribute to the development of the country is on the right track: Heck, it's
the only track that we have! There are absolutely no alternatives to &lt;em&gt;not
wanting people&lt;/em&gt; to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I do not see the point of getting &lt;em&gt;Malaysians to Malaysia&lt;/em&gt; in
order to achieve that. I feel the narrative of showing better lives for
Malaysians who returned home after years away, or of Malaysians who succeeded
&lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they left home is missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the 21st century you can be anywhere and still contribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, improvements in infrastructure, information technology and travel makes
it possible for any of us to be anywhere on this planet. In a 8-hour period you
can be in Helsinki or if you spend 30 hours, you can be in Beunos Aires. You can
communicate via email, share information on websites and discuss ideas face-to
face via Hangouts or Facetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who want to contribute to something are passionate at what they do and 
will know that they want to contribute. The missing piece is the effort that we
spend to identify these people, reach out to them and connect them to like-minded
people or institutions that can help them amplify their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TalentCorp says they have approved 4000 people within a period of 5 years since
2011. Malaysian overseas are estimated at 1 million people, which translates to
only 0.004%. Is 1000 per year of people enough to contribute? Is 0.004% an
acceptable acception rate after 5 years? Are we doing too little, or is this too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps TalentCorp's mandate is to identify and attract only talents with skills that
can only be utilized if they are present in the country, like surgeons to do
surgery. But we know contributing to something is more than that, and we need all the help
we can get, not only from the sciences but also engineering and arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also must not forget the home grown talents and people that are doing
wonderous jobs. Overseas Malaysias have different backgrounds, ideas and
approaches to the same problem we all have and these differences are what we
want to be accesible to our home grown talents. They can learn from each other,
improve and make something better together. Creating the missing piece of connecting
these dots between locals and abroad Malaysiams is where we should put more effort in,
regardless if the overseas talent will be coming home or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The writer checking email in front of Mont Saint Michel" src="http://iqbalabd.me/images/montsaintmichel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of the writer checking his email taken in front of Mont Saint Michel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home is where the heart is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part is the most important factor of all: Where we call home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home is not where we were born. Making a place home is a self-conscious
decision based on the different situation, personality and opportunities for any
given individual. This should and must be the overarching target for any 
returning program that we want to carry out: &lt;strong&gt;Making Malaysia home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once someone calls a place home, the good and the bad will be taken in stride.
It is human nature to better their own home, for themselves and the generations
to come, and when we can get people who want to contribute calling Malaysia
their home, it will be a sustainable success story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although based on the article above, there are individuals who would return back
to Malaysia because they did not find the bed or roses they thought were waiting
for them whereever they were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Who cares if there’s corruption and crime in Malaysia? I just go back, make
heaps of money, then live in a condo with proper security. Solved. Whereas
here, I’m just an average Joe, and I’m struggling just to keep my head above
water".  - See more at:
&lt;a href="//m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/the-other-side-of-malaysias-brain-drain-story#sthash.Z6zLaSYD.dpuf"&gt;http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/the-other-side-of-malaysias-brain-drain-story#sthash.Z6zLaSYD.dpuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people do not call Malaysia their home. Making money is their intention,
and when there are better opportunities elsewhere, they move on. What we should
focus on for the long term are the stayers, the builders and the committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this is what we agree to, to make Malaysia home, so the next big question is: 
&lt;em&gt;How do you convince people to call Malaysia their home?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, lets think of &lt;em&gt;what makes a good home?&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously you would not want to
live in a home that is fighting all the time. You do not want to live in a home
that is wrapped in poisonous polluting gasses. You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to live in a home that
is peaceful, clean and conducise to health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should accept and understand that the universal values that attract human beings 
with a purpose applies and this is where we should concentrate our effort in: 
The values of justice, fairness, equality, fair reward for hard work, 
a genuine effort in betterment, a chance to better oneself, rule of law: 
Similar to the so-called &lt;strong&gt;The American Dream&lt;/strong&gt;, a slogan that made
America the place to be for all people having dreams of a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have an upperhand over overseas Malaysians to call Malaysia home, as they 
have family, roots and the eternal love for Malaysian food. But we should not take 
those for granted. There are more things that needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And then it's not only Malaysians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's face it: Globalisation means people, capital and goods will move around at
a much easier and faster pace than it has ever before. Our competition is no
longer our neighbours like Singapore, Thailand or Indonesia, but it's New York,
Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris or even Banjul. It's not countries anymore but cities: 
Cities now try to attract the best people from anywhere around the world to come and live there.
If people would not want to stay in Kuala Lumpur, all of these other cities will
woo them and are more than happy to welcome their wealth, expertise and passion.
The faster we realize this, the better it is for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that when we get our head around at aiming to make Malaysia our
home, the universal values that apply to a good home will apply and attract many more
people, regardless of nationality, colour and creed. This is what makes a
country great: People believing in it and wanting to participate in it's growth
process. All these believers will come, and call Malaysia their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we reach this stage, we will be in a totally different playing field altogether. 
It will no longer be what race we are, or who are sons of soil, or where we are
from but we will be in the race to be the best in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in this vision of our country, where everyone wants to make it their
home, and believe in its potential and future. In the end, this is what we
mostly desire now: Believers in our country, it's potential and it's future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="current affairs"></category><category term="malaysia"></category><category term="talents"></category><category term="humans"></category><category term="brain-drain"></category></entry><entry><title>Yang di-Pertuan Agong is not "king".</title><link href="http://iqbalabd.me/agong-and-not-king.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-05T10:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2016-12-05T10:00:00+09:00</updated><author><name>Iqbal Abdullah</name></author><id>tag:iqbalabd.me,2016-12-05:/agong-and-not-king.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Malaysians do not have a king, but the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was an email I sent to The Star on referring to the Malaysian Head of State
using the appropriate proper noun. It was not published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refer to your news article on 16th Nov 2016 with the title
&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/11/16/king-and-queen-attend-parade-of-thanks-for-14th-yang-dipertuan-agong/"&gt;King and Queen attend parade of thanks for 14th Yang di-Pertuan
Agong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I read in your paper news about our Yang di-Pertuan Agong
and your paper refers to him as King and his consort as Queen, I
cringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Malaysians do not have a king. Spain has a king. Sweden has a king.
Monaco has a king. Japan has an emperor, while we Malaysian have our
Agong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a unique position even within this small world of ours. A king
generally implies a hereditary line of monarchs with power passed down
between families. Our Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected and even has a
deputy which are not from the same family unlike kings which have
crown princes which are nearly the time sons of the same family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our passports also refers to the Agong as "His Majesty the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agong is not a hereditary role, is a proper noun and referring to
a specific and important role in our country. There is no equivalent
english translation for our Agong, as the English language came from a
region and time where a ruler is a king and have absolute powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, you can refer to our Agong by addressing him by
"His Majesty" and his consort as "Her Majesty", or even the "Supreme
Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces" if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the few English papers with wide circulation in the country,
we can assume that your good paper will be read by many foreigners
visiting our shores. It would be best to give the proper introduction
to them concerning our Yang di-Pertuan Agong, by correctly referring
to our unique elected Head of State lest they'l have the impression
that the Federation of Malaysia have "kings".&lt;/p&gt;

KTMB Komuter service was. I was pretty pissed at that time. I don't understand
how KTMB cannot understand this very simple thing on providing a decent service to
it's customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I sent the email, I got a call from The Star while I was in Jaya Jusco in
Malacca and the person wanted to confirm that what I wrote about KTMB's aim of
getting MYR1 profit was correct before they published it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ON DEC 12, I took KTM’s Ekspres Sinaran Pagi from KL Sentral bound for
Singapore, which was originally scheduled to depart at 8.30am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I waited at the terminal, the departure time was rescheduled to 8.40am
and again to 8.55am. The train finally departed at 9am, and we reached
Singapore one hour later than the scheduled time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the KTM Komuter from Mid Valley to Seremban (Rawang-Seremban route) on
Dec 22, we waited from 9.10pm and the train arrived only at 9.40pm. We
finally reached Seremban at around 11pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KTMB customers waiting at the Mid Valley station resigned themselves to the
waiting, and some even opened up their work on the cement floor and tried to
get something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic signs at the platform were confusing and did not show correct
information. We were not notified the reason for the delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain passengers were inconsiderate, refusing to allow passengers to alight
first before boarding, pushing ahead with their big backpacks, having their
handphone ringtones on full volume and refusing to give up their seats for a
blind mother and child who boarded in Serdang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of taking the Komuter from Mid Valley to Seremban has left me
tired. I felt I have grown older by 10 years and my will to live has gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two points that I wish to share with KTMB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s economy, KTMB must realise that it is not an operator of
      railways. It must realise that it is a service provider, not much different
      from taxis or retail outlets. It just so happens that the service provider
      called KTMB is providing its service through railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is in transporting people, not goods. If KTMB truly wishes to
   reach its stated target of even RM1 profit, stay there or even go beyond
   that, it has to understand that the service of transporting people, in a
   timely and comfortable manner, will be the single most important revenue
   provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are important concepts that everyone in KTMB must realise and
understand, from the CEO down to the person maintaining the ticket machines
at the stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a layman’s point of view KTMB has great potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With highways being built every day and airline flights getting cheaper, it
is more important than ever that KTMB realise its potential as a service
provider, and the strength that its assets hold. KTMB owns tracks and
stations which are not affected by traffic yet that go direct to the heart of
towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia will change like other developed nations, where more and more people
commute to work from out-of-state into Kuala Lumpur. We see this happening
right here and now, and it is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are too many cars on the roads and everyone is tired of traffic jams in
the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is in place that will allow KTMB to be the leading transportation
service provider. All that KTMB needs to do is to leverage these assets and
by being reliable and punctual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be reliable and on time do not require KTMB to change its rolling stock
immediately, nor does it require it to send its staff to Tokyo to study how
JR (Japan Railways Group) does its job. All KTMB has to do is ride its own
trains and make notes of what it’s doing right and what it’s doing wrong, and
then fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

out of college during the summer of my first job at Sun Microsystems. It was published in 
&lt;a href="http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2001&amp;amp;dt=0809&amp;amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;amp;sec=Rencana&amp;amp;pg=re_06.htm"&gt;Utusan Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saya percaya dengan tahap teknologi dan capaian media kita sekarang, seseorang
itu tidak perlu lagi lulus universiti untuk mendapatkan kebolehan baik di dalam
bidang tertentu, terutamanya sains maklumat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetapi pokoknya ia bukan sahaja mengenai minat atau kebolehan, tetapi mentaliti
dan disiplin pelajar Melayu kita. Oleh sebab untuk membaiki mentaliti dan
disiplin pelajar Melayu ini juga, maka Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir
mencadangkan pelaksanaan sistem meritokrasi (walaupun sebagai eksperimen) mulai
sesi pengambilan pelajar akan datang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setelah melalui kehidupan belajar di universiti (walaupun saya belajar di salah
sebuah universiti awam di Jepun), saya dapat memahami jika dikatakan, walaupun
kelulusan yang baik itu penting, tetapi sebenarnya pembelajaran di univerisiti
adalah lebih daripada itu. Jika dibandingkan dengan kursus-kursus lain, kita
sedia maklum memang pembelajaran di universiti lebih susah dan membebankan,
kerana salah satu sebabnya ialah terdapat subjek-subjek lain yang langsung tiada
kaitan dengan kursus seseorang itu, tetapi ia harus diambil bagi memenuhi syarat
kreditnya untuk menamatkan kursus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetapi tidakkah kita terfikir, jika sistem pendidikan kita mahu menghasilkan
seorang programmer atau seorang jurutera, mengapa tidak dari awal lagi gaya
pembelajaran di univerisiti diubah? Ini kerana institut universiti itu bukan
hanya mahu menghasilkan seorang programmer atau jurutera tetapi seorang
profesional semua bidang, yang berdisiplin dan berwibawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidak ada gunanya jika seseorang itu boleh menulis kod program yang cukup bagus
tetapi masih tidak memahami sejarah negaranya, oleh itu tiada sikap patriotik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertahan selama empat tahun di universiti dan berhadapan dengan segala macam
masalah, kebanyakan bergantung dari dalam diri sendiri dan selebihnya dari luar,
telah mengajar saya pelbagai perkara. Bukan tidak pernah semasa di universiti,
saya menangis seorang diri di belakang dewan kuliah kerana rasa terlalu tertekan
untuk mendapatkan gred bagus dalam satu subjek yang saya langsung tidak
mempunyai minat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bukan tidak pernah dalam empat tahun itu saya terfikir untuk berhenti sahaja
belajar di universiti kerana saya rasa minat saya tidak ada dalam bidang
tertentu, dan saya percaya kebolehan diri untuk melakukan apa yang saya minat.
Pernah semasa saya di tahun dua, saya berdiri di hadapan pensyarah selama lebih
dua jam, sambil diherdik dan dimarahi kerana tugasan saya yang dikatakannya
tidak berapa elok walaupun saya bersengkang mata lebih tiga hari tiga malam
untuk menyiapkannya. Pada masa itu hanya Tuhan sahaja yang tahu betapa sakitnya
hati saya dan betapa mahu saya pulang saja ke Malaysia kerana tidak tahan lagi
dengan satu sistem pembelajaran yang apa-kenapa-dan-bagaimananya langsung
tidak saya fahami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semasa saya di tahun empat, pernah saya diminta oleh pensyarah untuk melakukan
pembentangan mengenai kajian yang sedang saya lakukan. Setelah membuat
pembentangan tersebut, saya telah dimarahi kerana pembentangan saya itu tidak
berapa memuaskan. Pensyarah tersebut berkata, Kenapa kamu tidak lakukan
seperti saya, dengan membuat nota dan rajah yang teliti, seperti saya lakukan
setiap kali kuliah? Saya berkata oleh kerana profesor adalah seorang
profesional dalam bidang tersebut, maka perkara itu sudah menjadi satu benda
yang biasa, dan tidak pula bagi saya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetapi beliau kemudian menjawab, Habis, kenapa kamu hadir di univerisiti?
Bukankah untuk menjadi seorang profesional? Saya terdiam. Memang benar kata
pensyarah saya itu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setelah memasuki alam pekerjaan, saya dapati sebenarnya apa yang diutamakan oleh
orang Jepun di sini bukanlah kelulusan peperiksaan ataupun kemahiran (walaupun
ia penting) tetapi kendiri dan sikap seseorang itu terhadap pekerjaannya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerana belajar itu suatu perkara yang tidak akan habis sehinggalah kita mati,
maka kemahiran dan pengetahuan masih boleh kita timba walaupun setelah tamat
universiti. Tetapi sikap itu harus dipupuk dari muda, bak kata pepatah,
Meluntur buluh biar dari rebungnya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empat tahun di universiti mengajar kita untuk bersikap profesional, berdisiplin
untuk mengikut sistem, tidak anti-establishment, sabar, gigih, bersemangat dan
bercita-cita tinggi. Apa yang tersurat di atas segulung ijazah itu tidak dapat
menggambarkan seribu satu perkara yang tersirat. Tetapi malangnya jika dilihat
fenomena pelajar Melayu kita di universiti sekarang, mereka seperti hilang punca
tentang mengapa mereka di sana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mungkin pelajar Melayu kita, seperti juga remaja Jepun sekarang, yang terlalu
mewah atas titik peluh generasi sebelumnya, tidak faham akan apa itu erti
kesusahan, lantas hilang fokus dan lupa akan matlamat diri sebagai pemuda-pemudi
bangsa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jika seperti selalu, jalan keluar yang senang dan cepat diberikan, sehingga
kiamat pun, orang Melayu kita akan tetap mencari jalan mudah untuk keluar
daripada segala macam masalah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidak semua orang boleh menjadi genius kerana itu adalah anugerah Tuhan, tetapi
semua orang boleh bersikap profesional dan berdisiplin, kerana sikap itu boleh
dipupuk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kita harus mempunyai keyakinan terhadap pemuda-pemudi Melayu kita yang walaupun
tanpa bantuan kerajaan, masih boleh menunjukkan kelayakan cukup bagus sehingga
boleh memberi persaingan kepada kaum-kaum lain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebih baik sistem meritokrasi ini dilaksanakan dalam keadaan kita berkuasa dan
boleh mengubahnya semula kepada sistem kuota jika ia tidak mencapai matlamat,
daripada ia dilakukan pada masa kita tiada kuasa dan tidak berkuasa untuk
memperbetulkan keadaan. Pelaksanaan sistem meritokrasi ini, walaupun ia pedih
dan pahit, tetapi saya percaya ia akan memberi ubat yang paling mujarab bagi
pewaris bangsa dan negara kita. Tabik saya kepada bakal mahasiswa Melayu yang
sanggup menerima cabaran ini. &lt;/p&gt;
